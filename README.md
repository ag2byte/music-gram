This is a temporary readme

All of us will add our part on a separate branch and then we will see what to merge

This will enable things to run in a parallel manner

Use the following suntax for commits:
- [added] (if a new feature is added or a new file is added)
- [changed] (existing code undergoes changes)

for example:
[added] readme.md
